title: How do I discover one?
---

There are a couple of ways to discover existing `azd-template` tagged repositories. Traditional search engine search, GitHub Search, blog posts,...

### 1. Using This Catalog
This is the challenge we are hoping to solve with the [gallery](/) site shown in this project. Each template is associated with the following:
 - architecture diagram
 - template repository
 - publication date
 - contributor identity
 - description
 - service tags (for architecture components)
 - language tags (for application code)
 - demoguide (what can a trainer demo out of running the deployment; what can a non-trainer learn from going through this scenario,...)

The Gallery provides both a **search** capability (to discover template by name) and a **filter** capability (to discover templates that match a specific and/or combination of criteria).
